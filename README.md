# Dynamic constra template

"Constra" is an HTML template developed by themefisher.com. You can download it from here: https://themefisher.com/products/constra

I am converting this static template into a dynamic website using Vue JS as frontend and Laravel as backend.

Right now, the home page is converted to Vue JS app.
